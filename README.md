E-Commerce Recommendation System

Recommendation systems for E-commerce are becoming more and more important in the digital age. They can enhance the browsing experience of users, directly guide customers to quickly and efficiently find what they need, and increase the sales volume of the platform. However, due to the characteristics of big data-based e-commerce recommender systems, recommender system technology is still facing the problems of limited resources, data validity, initial cold start, long-tail, system scalability, and so on. In this paper, we first introduce the importance of e-commerce recommendation and survey the above six challenges that it is facing. We then discuss some potential Research Directions. Furthermore, the kinds, advantages, and disadvantages of e-commerce recommendation are described, and finally, we propose future research directions that are worth studying in the future.
